Consider options like Greek yogurt with berries and granola, whole-wheat toast with avocado and eggs, or a smoothie with spinach, banana, and protein powder.\n",
            "*   **Fiber-Rich:** Starting your day with fiber aids digestion and promotes satiety. Oatmeal with fruit and nuts, a chia pudding, or whole-grain pancakes with berries are excellent choices.\n",
            "*   **Low-Carb:** If you're following a low-carb diet, focus on protein and healthy fats. Scrambled eggs with vegetables, a protein shake, or a small serving of full-fat yogurt with nuts and seeds are suitable options. \n",

            "**Time Constraints:**\n",

            "**Dietary Restrictions:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Gluten-Free:** Opt for gluten-free bread, oats, or cereals. You can also explore naturally gluten-free options like quinoa porridge or smoothies.\n",
            "*   **Dairy-Free:** Choose plant-based milk alternatives, yogurt, and cheese. Tofu scramble, chia pudding with coconut milk, or oatmeal with almond milk and fruit are great options.\n",
